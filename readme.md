# Fas-Disassembler for Visuallisp 0.8
===================================

![ScreenShot](http://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/1965/nw7j4n.png)

Autolisp is a programming language for AutoCAD.
Lisp sourcecode files have the extension LSP and 
the compiled Lisp-scripts FAS.
This program will decrypt the resource part of fas 
and fsl files (write it to disk) and disassemble the it.
With help of the disassembling you can see exactly :) 
what the program does, how thing are done and you 
can change some things with help of the offset and 
an Hexeditor.


### Keys:
Enter, Space, double click on a line to 
	jump to a offset that is in the Disasm
	Like "Goto 0213"

Backspace, Num'-' to 
	go back to old offset

´(key beside Backspace), Num'+' to 
	go forward


### Getting FSL-Files
All internal lisp programs of Visuallisp are store in the 
resource section of vllib.dll (or vl.arx in Autocad LT).
Use "Resource Hacker" or "Exescope" to dump 
these resources to disk and rename them to  *.fsl.


### FAS to LSP-Files
The data from the decompiler colum it written to
some *_.lsp. However decompiler is far from being
perfect. I really advice you to always 
also open the *.txt which contains all
information.


### Editing FAS-Files
For this purpose enable [HexWorkShop] and click some item.
Fas-Dis will start HexWorkShop jump there in via sendkey.
Sending keystrokes to another program is a little fragile.
For best results place the HexWorkShop Window beside 
Fas-Dis's main window and avoid overlapping.
Also take care for possible editing the fas file by error.
When asked to 'Save changes'. Click NO!
In HexWorkShop options enable 'Highlight changes' to better
see unintented changes. Use HWorks UNDO to revert changes.

When hexediting fas-files maybe this two commands come in handy:

<NOP> No Operation 
	Good for deleting (= Nop out) unwanted instructions
	Bytecode: 20h (Just Space) [or 62 or 63]
	Parameters: none

<jmp> short Jump to offset
	Good for jumping over unwanted instructions
	i.e. Fix Conditional Jump (=IF)
	Bytecode: 0Fh  [57h for FAR Jump]
	Size: 3 Byte [5 Byte]
	Parameters: 1
	Word 2 Bytes [Dword 4 Bytes] specify Bytes to Skip
	Example: '0F 0000' will point to the next
	 	 instruction after jmp

When doing changes pay attention about the stack being embalenced.
In case there are errors after editing - Decompiled the edited Fas
again to check/fix possible stack corruptions.

At the moment there is no documentation file for fas-commands. 
To get more information about the command please look at the function 
'InterpretStream()' in FasFile.cls and learn from the fas-disassembling.

Some specifications about the Fas-format are here:
